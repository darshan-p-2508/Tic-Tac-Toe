# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the "tic-tac-toe" GitHub repository! This project is a classic tic-tac-toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all nine squares are full, the game is over. The app version of the game was created using webintoapp.com website, which makes it easy to turn your web-based projects into mobile apps.
